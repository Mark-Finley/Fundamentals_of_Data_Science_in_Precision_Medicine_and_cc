    "## What is metabolomics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Metabolomics is the scientific study of the set of metabolites present within an organism, cell, or tissue. Scientists find studying metabolomics useful because it reveals the unique ‚Äúchemical fingerprints‚Äù that help them track different biological processes that are happening in the body [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you donate your blood samples to a scientist after you eat a healthy high fiber lunch (eg. a colorful salad with spinach, red pepper, black beans), versus a high fat and high carb lunch (e.g., a bowl of spaghetti with meatballs), the scientist can see different metabolites compositions in your blood samples. The different metabolites compositions are the result of your body trying to break down the meals in those two different lunch scenarios. \n"

    "> \n",
    "> Next time you hear the phrase ‚ÄúYou are what you eat‚Äù, you will know it is true from the metabolomics perspective [2]. Having healthier diets that contain diverse fibers and proteins creates metabolites in your body that allows you to function more efficiently, such as having better attention, athletic performance, and immune responses. Adding something healthy in your meal each day is the most under-rated, economic, and effective way to lead a better quality life. Moreover, It is an exercise of learning to spontaneously follow disciplines. The earlier you start, the more you will see the compounded benefits it brings to your study, work, relationship with yourself and other people.\n"
